#TODO 

### Sprint 1: May 03-05, Friday

- Install pip, gymnasium and generate requirements.txt
- Write the MDP environment in [src/mdp.py](src/mdp.py)
- Test it using the Value Iteration and regular Simulations. Verify that the average value in regular simulations converge to VI.
- Setup a workflow if time permits. Workflow can clean the code, and a few iterations of Simulation.
